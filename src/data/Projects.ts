    "Sweet Candy" is an ambitious E-Commerce project which is characterized by offering a front-office (online store), which allows the purchase of products that the store itself provides, in this case candy, as well as giving access to many other functions such as the wish list, customer order management, payment gateway ...
    
    Plus, the administrator has access to the back-office (management panel) where you can organize the store quickly and accurately. It offers functionalities such as the management of products, categories, brands and catalogs, as well as their respective discounts. In addition, retailers, suppliers and other logistics are custom-configured and order management can be organized in a simple way thanks to its statuses.
    Finally, a system of statistics and results is provided in order to know which products work best, the most successful catalogs or the number of sales and profits acquired in the last days, months and years.`,
